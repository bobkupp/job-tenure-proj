# job-tenure-proj

Assumptions:

- individuals need to be at least 18 years old to be assigned to a job

- individuals can only be assigned to a job in their state of residence (a potential enhancement 
might be to allow them to also work in adjacent/nearby states)

- start dates are randomly generated (within some fixed parameters), with some input from the 
employee's age

- end dates are randomly generated (again, with some fixed parameters), for a date after the
start date

- the number of jobs an employee might have in their work history is dependent on the number of
employers in their state
